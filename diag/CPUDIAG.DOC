          Microcosm Associates CPU Test/Diagnostic

                          for the

                       8080 and 8085

 This is an extensive diagnostic for the 8080 and 8085 CPU, and 
exercises  most functions of the processor.  This diagnostic is 
NOT for the Z80,  but may be modified as required to handle the 
incompatible  "Sign/Parity  Flag  Bit".   This  diagnostic  was 
especially helpful in tracking down problems I encountered with 
early production run's of the NEC 8080 which exhibited problems 
with the "Aux Carry Flag Bit" when doing "DAA's".

 A  succesful  run of the program will  display  the  following 
message:

CPU IS OPERATIONAL

 an  unsuccesful run of the program will display the  following 
message:

CPU HAS FAILED!   ERROR EXIT=NNNN

 Where  "NNNN" is the address location AFTER the test  failure. 
The  CPUDIAG.PRN file may then be referenced as to the  address 
location  "EXIT" of the failure,  to determine the exact nature 
of the problem. Error address's were not included in the ".DOC" 
file,  because  the program is typically relocated in PROM  for 
system  diagnostic  purposes.  The  program  has  however  been 
CP/Mified to run as a ".COM" file,  with BDOS calls for console 
I/O.

 This  program  also serves as a very good "tutorial aid"  when 
traced  with Digital Research's DDT or SID,  to gain  a  better 
understanding of register manipulation and arithmetic processes 
of the 8080 and 8085 CPU.
