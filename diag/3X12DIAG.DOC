        Icom FD3712 Single Density Disk Controller

        Icom FD3812 Double Density Disk Controller

 This  is  an  extensive "production test/diagnostic"  for  the 
Pertec/Icom  Single  and Double Density  Disk  Controller.  The 
files  3712DIAG.ASM  and 3812DIAG.ASM are  "self  documenting", 
with a "menu display" of test options at the first execution of 
either program.  These programs were originaly written for  the 
MITS  Altair  8800b  Computer,  and therefor utilize  the  MITS 
console  port  address's  of  10  and  11  hexadecimal.   These 
address's  may  easily  be modified  by  changing  the  console 
equates  as  required  by you console  I/O.  In  addition,  the 
3712DIAG.ASM  file  is compatible for testing  the  older  Icom 
"Frugal Floppy" system.

 Primary  differences between the FD3712 and FD3812 diagnostics 
are   in  "density  select"  options  and  diskette   formating 
capabilities of the 3812DIAG.ASM file,  which supports the  IBM 
single density/single sided format,  "1D" format,  "2D" format, 
and  "2D Extended (1024 bytes per sector,  8 sectors per track) 
format  ("2D  Extended" is hardware dependent on  DMA  transfer 
capability).

 This code was initially written by me about 3 years ago,  when 
I  first got into codeing for the 8080,  and is therefor a  bit 
"amateurish"  in some areas...that "INIT" routine with all  the 
"STA's" for example! But in any case, the code does work  quite 
well for a first effort on my part...
